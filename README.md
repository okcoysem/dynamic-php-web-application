# Project Name

## Project Overview

This project is a dynamic PHP web application that features a simple structure for navigation through various pages, including home, tournament information, and an admin dashboard. The application utilizes session management for user roles, ensuring secure access to administrative functionalities. The main design follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) principle with a clear separation of concerns.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. Set up your database using the provided configuration file in `config/database.php`. Make sure to adjust the database connection settings as necessary.

3. Ensure you have a local server environment set up (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, or LAMP) to run PHP applications.

4. Place the project files in the server's document root or configure your server to point to the project directory.

5. Access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost/your-project-directory`.

## Usage

To navigate through the application:

- Visit the home page to view the default content.
- Access the tournament page by appending `?page=tournament` to the URL.
- For administrative access, append `?page=admin` but ensure you are logged in as a user with the appropriate role (admin or super_admin).

## Features

- **Dynamic Page Routing**: Allows users to navigate between different pages (home, tournament, admin) based on URL parameters.
- **User Role Management**: Provides access controls for admin functionalities to authorized users only.
- **Input Sanitization**: Implements input handling to prevent XSS attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes PHP sessions to manage user authentication and roles.
